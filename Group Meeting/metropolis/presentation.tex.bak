\begin{frame}[fragile]{Aluminium as negative electrode}
\begin{enumerate}
\item High theoretical mass capacity of 2200 mAh/g.
\item Theoretical capacity of 993 mAh/g, corresponding to the formation of LiAl phase, which is considerably higher than that of commercially used graphite negative electrode (372 mAh/g), but much less than capacity for Si (3579 mAh/g).
\item However, Al exhibits approximately 3 times lower volume expansion than Si.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Conclusion %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 
\section{Conclusion}
\begin{frame}{Insights gained thus far...}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Electrochemical curves conformed to thermodynamic studies.

\item Stability of the electrode was studied.

\item Formation of $\beta$-LiAl phase on the negative electrode.

\item Al - Li system showed reversible phase transformation.

\item The percentage straining due to the phase transformation was 89.6\%.

\item Microstructural characterization of Al-Li electrode revealed non-uniform LiAl phase growth.

\item SEM EBSD texture studies revealed orientation dependence of LiAl phase growth.

\item In situ stress measurements using MOSS and Stoney's equation showed that, Al underwent extensive plastic deformation with a flow stress in the range of 1.2 - 1.5 GPa in compression (during lithiation) and 0.7 - 1 GPa in tension (during delithiation).

\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Scope for future work %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Scope for future work}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Al-Li half cell showed good phase reversibility during eletrochemical cycling. So Lithium ion full cells with Al as negative electrode can be studied. 
\item Studies on other phases formed on negative electrode during electrochemical cycling and their corresponding effect on half cell performance can be done.
\item Studies on single crystal aluminium as negative electrode can be done.
