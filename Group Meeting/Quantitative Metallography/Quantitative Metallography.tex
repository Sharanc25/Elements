\begin{frame}[fragile]{Heyn Intercept Method}
url: https://vacaero.com/information-resources/metallography-with-george-vander-voort/1273-grain-size-measurement-the-heyn-intercept-method.html
In the 1974 revision of E 112 by Halle Abrams, he introduced the three-concentric circle test grid and a more formal methodology for performing intercept grain size measurements. His idea [2, 3] was that the total circumference of the three circles was 500 mm and he suggested adjusting the magnification so that, on average, about 100 grain boundary intersections, P, or grain interceptions, N, would be obtained. Then, five random applications of the three-circle grid would yield ~500 N or P hits which would give ~10\% relative accuracy. This strategy was verified in a subsequent interlaboratory round-robin [4]. However, counting errors seemed to be greater when each placement yielded ~100 counts compared to a magnification that yielded ~50 counts. So, the standard was modified to recommend using a magnification that yielded ~50 counts per placement. The goal was still to get ~500 total counts. Ten randomly chosen fields would give a more representative estimate of the grain size than five fields.

To do the intercept method, one counts either grain boundary intersections, P, or grains intercepted, N, by the circles. For a single phase structure, it is easier to do P counts. For a two-phase structure, one must do N counts. For a single phase grain structure P = N and either count can be made. The P or N count is divided by the true line length, LT, which is the line length divided by the magnification, L/M. This yields PL or NL, the number of intersections per unit length or the number of interceptions per unit length. The reciprocal of PL or NL is the mean lineal intercept length, L3, which may be designated as l. The mean lineal intercept is related to G by the following empirical equation:
							G = (-6.6457 log L3)  – 3.298      
							
							
							Measurement of Grain Size Using the Mean Lineal Intercept Method
ASTM Standard E 112-88 describes the lineal intercept method in general and the Heyn procedure
in particular. The following is an abbreviated version of the Heyn procedure.
1. Magnification, Test Line and Fields
C Ideally, the length of a single test line and the magnification should be such that 50 intercepts
can be counted.
C The use of multiple fields to obtain 50 intercepts is discouraged, although permitted, due to the
bias which will decrease the accuracy as the number of fields increases.
2. Count the intercepts...
C An intercept is the segment of the test line which overlays one grain.
C Count 1 for each intercept and ½ for each time an end of the test line falls in a grain.
... or count the intersections
C An intersection is the point where the test line cuts a grain boundary.
C Count 1 for each intersection, 1 for each tangential intersection, ½ when an end of the test line
ends exactly on a grain boundary and 1½ when the intersection occurs at a triple point.
3. Measurement Strategy
C Make counts on 3 to 5 blindly selected and widely separate fields to obtain a reasonable average
for the specimen. Additional counts may be required to obtain the desired statistics.
C Use four or more orientations of the test line to eliminate effects due the moderate departures
from an equiaxed structure.
C Use orthogonal sets of parallel test lines if the structure is distinctly non-equiaxed.
4. Tabulate the Results
C Calculate the average lineal intercept length.
C Calculate the standard deviation.
C Calculate the confidence interval for the desired confidence interval.
5. Report the Results
C When reporting the results include the magnification, length of the test line, total number of
intercepts counted along with the mean intercept length and the confidence interval for the stated
confidence level.
