IISc Thesis Folder Structure:
1. Each section (Introduction, Experimental Details, etc..) are inside the "Chapters" folder.
2. Images are inside their corresponding folders (like Tensile Test, Texture, etc..). This structure is
   used to facilitate other users to go through the folder structure with ease.
3. Each directory (like Tensile Test, Texture, etc..) which contains data, contains a "Image" folder. This
   folder consists of all images that go into the thesis.
