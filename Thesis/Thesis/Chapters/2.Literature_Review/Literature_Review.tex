\chapter{Literature Review}
Titanium can exist in two allotropic forms: alpha (a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure) and beta (a body-cen- tered cubic structure) (Ref 7.1–7.4). In pure tita- nium, the alpha (a) phase is stable up to 880 °C (1620 °F), at which point it transforms to the beta (b) phase; the beta phase is stable from 880 °C (1620 °F) to the melting point. At room temperature, pure titanium consists of the alpha phase. However, the alloys can contain alpha, mixtures of alpha and beta, or beta phases, de- pending on the alloy content and conditions. Thus, the alloys are classified into these structural types: alpha (α), alpha-beta (α-β), and beta (β).
