% Try to use mostly jpg images for the thesis. By using \DeclareGraphicsExtensions, we can alter the way LaTeX searches for the files. Another way to speed up the rendering is to mention graphics extension for all the included graphics. http://macosx-tex.576846.n2.nabble.com/Is-there-a-better-alternative-to-DeclareGraphicsExtensions-td2483186.html

%% Command for degree Celcius/Farenheit

\newcommand{\degC}{\ensuremath{^{\circ}}C}  % Degree command is already used by iiscthes.cls
\newcommand{\degF}{\ensuremath{^{\circ}}F}

%% \graphicspath makes runtime very slow. Instead use absolute path for every image. Use the following commands which contains the file absolute path. Absolute path also prevents .eps file error. Also mention file extension for images for faster execution.
