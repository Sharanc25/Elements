\subsection{EDM Cutting}
The samples were cut in EDM. To identify Surface and Cross-Section samples, an additional L-shaped groove was made on all the Cross-Section samples.

The Surface and the Cross-Section microstructure are taken from the same sample. The Cross-Section has a thin line to differentiate it from the Surface.
